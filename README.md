# Metamodeling

The aim of this project is to design a liquid hydrogen powered aircraft, with performances close to the A320, using the Python library MARILib (Multidisciplinary Airplane Research Integrated Library) and, more specifically, a function called H2TurboFan. The current literature about airplane design indicates that the Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW) of the airplane is a good criterion to optimize a design.
